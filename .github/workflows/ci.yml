# CI Workflow - PHASE_S Quality Gates
#
# This workflow enforces the quality gates defined in AI_STATE.md CI/CD Contract.
# All jobs MUST pass before code can be merged to main.
#
# Quality Gates:
# ✅ All tests pass with zero warnings (test job)
# ✅ Build succeeds for all packages (build job)
# ✅ Node 20.19.0 + pnpm 10.24.0 version lock
# ✅ Frozen lockfile (no dependency drift)
# ✅ pnpm store cached for performance
