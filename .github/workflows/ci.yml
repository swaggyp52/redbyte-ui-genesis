# CI Workflow - Definition of Done (DoD) Compliance
#
# This workflow enforces the quality gates defined in docs/specs/dod.md
# All jobs MUST pass before code can be merged to main.
#
# DoD Checklist Coverage:
# ✅ TypeScript strict mode compliance (typecheck job)
# ✅ ESLint with zero errors (lint job)
# ✅ Prettier formatting (lint job)
# ✅ All tests pass (test job)
# ✅ Build succeeds (build job)
# ✅ NPM publish structure valid (publish-check job)
# ✅ Code coverage tracked (coverage job)
# ✅ Accessibility compliance (accessibility job)
# ✅ Performance budgets (performance job)
