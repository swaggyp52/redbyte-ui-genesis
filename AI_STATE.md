\## Architectural Invariants (DO NOT BREAK)



These rules are permanent unless changed here:



\- OS metaphor is canonical (boot → desktop → apps)

\- Monorepo structure is authoritative

\- Packages are not merged or flattened

\- Legal attribution must reference Connor Angiel

\- `main` is always production

\- Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys from `main`

\- No AI agent may introduce automation bots without approval



\### Launcher Contract

The Launcher is the canonical OS entry point with these enforced behaviors:

\- Launcher can always be invoked via Ctrl/Cmd+K global shortcut

\- Launcher is a singleton app (only one instance allowed)

\- When invoked and minimized, Launcher restores and gains focus

\- When invoked and already focused, Launcher reuses existing window

\- Launcher does NOT steal focus when dismissed

\- Launcher gains focus when opened, even if no other window is focused

\- Shell.openWindow enforces singleton + focus behavior for all singleton apps


\### Window \& Shell Lifecycle Contract

Focus surface and interaction rules:

\- New windows always receive focus on creation

\- Focusing a window unfocuses all other windows (single-focus invariant)

\- Minimized windows remain in window store but are excluded from visible layout

\- Minimized windows retain their focus state (focus does not auto-transfer)

\- Maximized windows use mode='maximized' but z-index ordering still applies

\- Z-index is unique per window and increases monotonically

\- Focusing a window raises its z-index above all others


Dock interaction rules:

\- Clicking Dock icon for singleton app restores minimized window + focuses

\- Clicking Dock icon for non-singleton app creates new instance (not impl)

\- Dock never creates duplicate singleton windows

\- Dock running indicator shows only non-minimized windows


Keyboard semantics (OS-level):

\- Cmd/Ctrl+K opens Launcher (global, always available)

\- Cmd/Ctrl+, opens Settings (global, when Settings exists)

\- Escape in Launcher closes Launcher

\- Escape in Desktop clears icon selection

\- Cmd/Ctrl+W closes focused window (not implemented)


\### Files App Contract

Files is the first real multi-window workflow proving the OS substrate:

\- Files is a non-singleton app (multiple windows allowed)

\- Each Files window has independent navigation state

\- Multiple Files windows can exist simultaneously

\- Dock click on Files icon opens a NEW Files window (non-singleton behavior)

\- Closing one Files window does NOT affect other Files windows

\- Window title reflects current folder (e.g. "Files — Documents")

\- Title updates do NOT trigger focus/z-index side effects

\- Keyboard navigation: Arrow keys move selection, Enter opens folder, Escape closes window


### Settings App Contract

Settings is the canonical system configuration interface with strict singleton semantics:

\- Settings is a STRICT singleton (only one Settings window may ever exist)

\- Dock click on Settings icon restores minimized Settings window + focuses

\- Dock click on Settings icon when already open focuses existing window

\- Global Cmd/Ctrl+, shortcut opens Settings (registered in Shell keyboard handler)

\- Closing Settings window does NOT lose persisted state (settings survive window close)

\- Settings changes propagate live to Shell, Desktop, Dock, and all windows

\- No flicker, no remounts when settings change (React state updates only)

\- Settings state lives outside Settings component (survives window lifecycle)

\- Settings persist to localStorage and reload on Shell boot

\- Corrupted localStorage resets to safe defaults (no crash)

\- Keyboard navigation: Arrow keys move selection, Enter activates, Escape closes window


### Intent System Contract

Intents enable explicit app-to-app interaction without breaking isolation:

\- Intents are EXPLICIT, user-initiated actions (never implicit or automatic)

\- Intents are routed by the Shell, NOT apps directly (no app-to-app calls)

\- Target apps may be singleton or non-singleton (Shell respects manifest)

\- Intents may create new windows or reuse existing ones (per manifest rules)

\- Intent payloads are immutable once dispatched (no mutation in transit)

\- No global state for intents (routing is synchronous, no event bus)

\- Intents must be visible and intentional (button, menu, or keyboard shortcut)

\- No hidden side effects (all intent actions are explicit user choices)


### Command System Contract

Commands are system-level actions for power-user workflows without adding global state:

\- Commands are SYSTEM-LEVEL actions (operate on focused window or global OS state)

\- Commands are STATELESS and SYNCHRONOUS (no async side effects)

\- Commands are triggered ONLY by keyboard shortcuts or command UI (never automatic)

\- Commands operate on the focused window when applicable (or no-op if no focus)

\- Commands do NOT open new windows (only manipulate existing windows or OS state)

\- Commands do NOT fire when typing in text inputs (respect editable targets)

\- Command dispatch lives in Shell keyboard handler (no global command bus)

\- Commands reuse existing window store functions (no new primitives unless required)


Available commands:

\- **focus-next-window**: Cycle to next non-minimized window by descending zIndex (wraps around)

\- **focus-prev-window**: Cycle to previous non-minimized window by descending zIndex (wraps around)

\- **close-focused-window**: Close the currently focused window (respects singleton semantics)

\- **minimize-focused-window**: Minimize the currently focused window (retains in store)

\- **restore-last-minimized**: Restore most recently minimized window (not implemented yet)


Keyboard shortcuts:

\- Cmd/Ctrl+\` (backtick): focus-next-window

\- Cmd/Ctrl+W: close-focused-window

\- Cmd/Ctrl+M: minimize-focused-window

\- Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P: Open Command Palette (lists available commands)


### System Search Contract

System Search is the unified discovery surface for apps, commands, and intent targets:

\- System Search is GLOBAL and MODAL (only one instance, invoked via Cmd/Ctrl+Space)

\- System Search is READ-ONLY until confirmed (no side effects before Enter)

\- System Search aggregates registered apps, commands, and intent-capable targets

\- System Search does NOT replace Launcher visually (Launcher remains accessible via Cmd/Ctrl+K)

\- System Search is for SPEED and DISCOVERY (not persistence or history)


Search result types (priority order):

\- **Apps**: Registered apps from rb-apps registry (Launcher, Files, Settings, Playground, etc.)

\- **Commands**: Available commands from Command System (focus-next-window, close-focused-window, etc.)

\- **Intent Targets**: Intent-capable actions (e.g. "Open in Playground")


Search behavior:

\- Simple string matching (startsWith / includes, case-insensitive)

\- No fuzzy scoring, no ranking heuristics, no async search

\- No indexing engine, no recent history, no persistence

\- Results grouped by section (Apps, Commands, Intent Targets)


Keyboard behavior:

\- Cmd/Ctrl+Space: Open System Search

\- ArrowUp / ArrowDown: Navigate results

\- Enter: Execute selected item

\- Escape: Close search without side effects


Execution behavior:

\- App → openWindow(appId)

\- Command → executeCommand immediately

\- Intent Target → dispatchIntent via Shell


Focus and safety:

\- Search does NOT trigger inside text inputs (respects editable targets)

\- Closing search restores previous focus

\- Search does NOT open windows until Enter is pressed
