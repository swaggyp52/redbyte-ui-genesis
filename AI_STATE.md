This file is the single authoritative source of truth for:

\- Project phase

\- Architectural invariants

\- Allowed operations

\- Current objectives

\- Completed milestones



ALL AI agents (ChatGPT, Claude, Codex, others) MUST:

1\. Read this file before proposing or executing work

2\. Treat it as higher priority than prior chat context

3\. Update this file after completing any task or phase

\## Project Identity



Name: RedByte OS Genesis  

Owner: Connor Angiel  

Type: Browser-based OS-style simulation \& construction platform  

Stack: TypeScript, React, Vite, pnpm, Cloudflare Pages  

Canonical Branch: `main`

\## Development Philosophy



\- Terminal-first development only

\- GitHub UI actions are forbidden unless explicitly stated

\- One change-set per commit

\- No speculative refactors

\- No global changes without explicit authorization



---



\## Architectural Invariants (DO NOT BREAK)



These rules are permanent unless changed here:



\- OS metaphor is canonical (boot → desktop → apps)

\- Monorepo structure is authoritative

\- Packages are not merged or flattened

\- Legal attribution must reference Connor Angiel

\- `main` is always production

\- Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys from `main`

\- No AI agent may introduce automation bots without approval

\## Forbidden Actions



AI agents must NOT:

\- Reformat files unnecessarily

\- Introduce new branches without instruction

\- Open stacked PRs

\- Modify licensing terms implicitly

\- Rename packages or folders

\- Mechanical refactors

\- Scripted replacements

\- Documentation improvements

\- Test fixes

\- Lint fixes

\## Handoff Protocol



After completing work, an AI agent MUST:

1\. Update phase status or objectives

2\. Append a short factual Change Log entry

3\. Avoid narrative or commentary

\## Change Log



\### 2025-12-13

\- Corrected legal attribution spelling to Connor Angiel across entire codebase

\- Commit: 5b353687

\### 2025-12-14

\- Added docs/ai-usage-rules.md to document existing AI usage governance within the repo

\- Marked objective “Document AI usage rules inside repo” as complete; phase unchanged

\- Added docs/legal-attribution.md as canonical attribution guidance; marked objective “Centralize legal attribution” as complete; phase unchanged

\- Added CI legal/trademark guard job to scan tracked files and verify Connor Angiel attribution reference in AI_STATE.md; marked objective “Add CI guard against incorrect attribution” as complete; phase unchanged

\- Hardened CI legal_guard patterns/output to avoid banned literals and prevent self-triggering; phase unchanged

\### 2025-12-15
\- Removed banned boilerplate/legal phrases and trademark symbols across tracked files to satisfy CI legal_guard; objectives unchanged; phase unchanged
