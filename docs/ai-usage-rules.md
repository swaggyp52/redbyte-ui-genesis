# AI Usage Rules

- **Authority:** `AI_STATE.md` is the single source of truth for phases, invariants, and allowed actions; read it before any work and update it after completing tasks.
- **Architectural invariants:** Keep the OS metaphor (boot → desktop → apps), preserve the monorepo with independent packages, honor `main` as production with Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys, and never add automation bots without approval.
- **Legal attribution:** All references must cite Connor Angiel; do not introduce trademark claims or use ™ / ® symbols.
- **Change discipline:** Make small, reversible changes only, and record meaningful updates in the `AI_STATE.md` ledger.
